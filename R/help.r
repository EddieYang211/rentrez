#' rentrez
#'
#' rentrez provides functions to search for, discover and download data from
#' the NCBI's databeses using their EUtils function. 
#'
#' Users are expected to know a little bit about the EUtils API, which is well
#' documented: \url{http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25500/}
#'
#' In the past, the NCBI has published guidelines for the use of this API, 
#' which included limiting very large queries or sequences of queries to 
#' non-peak times (evenings or weekends US-time), sending no more than three
#' queries per second and using the WebEnv functions (not yet implimented in
#' rentrez... I'll get on to it now)
